In the hush of twilight's gentle fall,
Where the sun and moon in balance stand,
A whispered tale to nightwind calls,
Of dreams that dance in starlit sand.

Beneath the vast and endless sky,
Where shadows grow and secrets lie,
The heart unfolds its melody,
In hues of gold and crimson die.

Each leaf that falls from aged trees,
A silent sonnet to the breeze,
Tells of lifeâ€™s fleeting symphony,
And love that blooms then fades with ease.

The river flows, its gentle rhyme,
Reflects the twinkle of each time,
Carrying whispers of the past,
Into an eternal, boundless vast.

Oh, wanderer beneath the moon,
With thoughts as deep as oceans blue,
Embrace the night, its quiet truth,
For in darkness, souls renew.

In this dance of light and shade,
Emotions, like wildfire, are displayed,
In every word left unsaid,
Lies a poem waiting to be played.

So, let your spirit roam free,
Beneath the stars, wild and gleaming,
For in this universe, you'll see,
Endless verses, eternally redeeming.
